PinForge Execution Agent Protocol

Purpose
This file is the single coordination surface between the Chief Architect (design and supervision) and the Execution Agent (implementation). The Execution Agent should treat each Super Milestone as a single delivery and report only once per milestone, after all batches inside it are complete.

Rules of Engagement
1. No micro reporting. Only milestone level reporting.
2. Offline first. Do not introduce network required flows or new online dependencies unless explicitly approved.
3. Use existing stack only: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tauri, Rust, plain CSS.
4. Respect OpenSpec: any new capability, breaking change, or architecture shift MUST be proposed in OpenSpec before implementation.
5. Keep changes focused. Avoid unrelated refactors.

Audit Gate
The Chief Architect will audit milestone output against:
1. OpenSpec requirements and scenario coverage
2. Offline first constraint
3. Correct dependency usage and minimal new dependencies
4. Functional completeness vs acceptance criteria
