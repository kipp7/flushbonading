PROJECT SUPERVISION MEMORY

Timestamp: 2025/12/25 12:07:16

Part 1 The Core Mission
Goal: PinForge, offline first desktop tool for STM32 pin planning, sensor fit, conflict checks, wiring visualization, and exports
Role: Architect and Supervisor, Non Executant
Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tauri, Rust, plain CSS, no backend, no database

Part 2 Task Tracking List
Current Super Milestone: MS 01 M2 foundation hardening and enablement
Batch 000 | Description: Establish supervision memory and batching framework | OpenSpec Ref: none | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 010 | Description: Preemptive architecture definition and baseline specs (truth) | OpenSpec Ref: openspec specs (pin planner, catalog import, pin constraints, hardware export, codegen spl) | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 011 | Description: Create approved OpenSpec change and publish MS 01 handoff package | OpenSpec Ref: openspec changes update pinforge m2 foundation | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 020 | Description: Establish engineering constitution AGENTS md and archive legacy template | OpenSpec Ref: AGENTS md and openspec AGENTS md | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 021 | Description: Driver relay protocol files for MS 01 created and updated | OpenSpec Ref: docs guides ai execution agent ms01 md and docs execution agent protocol txt | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 022 | Description: Validate OpenSpec change update pinforge m2 foundation strict | OpenSpec Ref: openspec validate update pinforge m2 foundation strict | Status: DONE | Audit Outcome: VERIFIED
Batch 012 | Description: Execution Agent implements MS 01 batches 01 through 07 | OpenSpec Ref: docs MS 01 super milestone and openspec changes update pinforge m2 foundation | Status: READY FOR DISPATCH | Audit Outcome: not started
Batch 005 | Description: MS 01 Batch 05 Planning Intelligence | OpenSpec Ref: openspec changes update pinforge m2 foundation specs pin planner spec md | Status: [IN_PROGRESS] | Audit Outcome: waiting milestone report
Batch 013 | Description: Chief Architect audit of MS 01 deliverables | OpenSpec Ref: acceptance criteria in MS 01 and OpenSpec validate strict | Status: PENDING | Audit Outcome: not started

Part 3 Supervision Log
Last Action: Finalized AGENTS md engineering constitution, archived the legacy template, created MS 01 execution guide, and validated the OpenSpec change in strict mode
Next Action: Dispatch the MS 01 driver instruction to the Execution Agent and wait for one final milestone report for audit
Risk Assessment: Risk of scope drift inside a large milestone, mitigate via strict OpenSpec scenarios, mandatory gates, and a single acceptance gate at milestone end
